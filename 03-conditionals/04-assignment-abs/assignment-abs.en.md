# Absolute Value

Taking the _absolute value_ of a number is basically stripping away its sign.
For example, the absolute value of 5 is simply 5, and the absolute value of -3 is 3.

Python comes with a function [`abs`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs) built-in which computes this absolute value.
However, it makes for a good exercise to implement it yourself.

### `TASK`

Write a function `my_abs(x)` that returns the absolute value of `x`.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> my_abs(5)
5

>>> my_abs(-1)
1
```
