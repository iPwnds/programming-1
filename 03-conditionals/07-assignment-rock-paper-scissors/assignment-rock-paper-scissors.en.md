# Rock Paper Scissors

We want to play a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
To those who are unfamiliar with the rules: two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper or scissors.
The outcome is determined by the following rules:

- If both players picked the same option, it's a tie.
- Rock beats scissors.
- Paper beats rock.
- Scissors beat paper.

We need a way to represent the three options.
Let's use numbers (later we'll see there are better ways):

| Option   | Representation |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Rock     | 0              |
| Paper    | 1              |
| Scissors | 2              |

There are three possible outcomes.
Again, we need a way to represent these:

| Option        | Representation |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Tie           | 0              |
| Player 1 wins | 1              |
| Player 2 wins | 2              |

### `TASK`

Write a function `rock_paper_scissors(player1_choice, player2_choice)` that returns `0`, `1` or `2`, depending on who won.

Make use of a `if-elif-else` chain.

#### USAGE

```python
# Both players picked rock, so it's a tie
>>> rock_paper_scissors(0, 0)
0

# Paper vs scissors, scissors wins
>>> rock_paper_scissors(1, 2)
2

# Rock vs scissors, rock wins
>>> rock_paper_scissors(0, 2)
1
```
