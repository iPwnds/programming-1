# Operators

Just like integers and booleans, strings have all kinds of operations defined on them.
We'll discuss a number of them here.
We start with an overview, after which we shortly discuss them in turn.

| Syntax         | Result     | Description              |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `"ab" + "cd"`  | `"abcd"`   | Concatenation            |
| `"ab" * 3`     | `"ababab"` | Repetition               |
| `"a" in "abc"` | `True`     | Membership               |
| `"a" == "a"`   | `True`     | Equality                 |
| `"a" != "a"`   | `False`    | Inequality               |
| `"a" < "b"`    | `True`     | Lexicographic comparison |
| `"a" <= "b"`   | `True`     | Lexicographic comparison |
| `"a" > "b"`    | `False`    | Lexicographic comparison |
| `"a" >= "b"`   | `False`    | Lexicographic comparison |
| `len("abc")`   | `3`        | Length                   |

## String Concatenation

Concatenation is a fancy name for joining strings together.

```python
>>> "Hello" + "World"
"HelloWorld"
```

As you can see, you can add strings together using the `+` operator.

### `EXAMPLE`

Some code that exemplifies the difference between integers and strings:

```python
>>> 1 + 2
3

>>> "1" + "2"
"12"
```

### `INFO`

The operator `+` is reused in many places:

- You can add integers: `5 + 8`.
- You can add floats: `1.2 + 3.4`.
- You can add strings: `"abc" + "def"`.

Assigning multiple meanings to the same thing is called _overloading_, or, in our case, more specifically, [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading).
At a later point, we will discuss how you can overload operators yourself.

## Repetition

The `*` operator allows you to repeat a string an arbitrary number of times:

```python
>>> "x" * 10
'xxxxxxxxxx'
```

## Membership Checking

The `in` (and its negation `not in`) can be used to see if a string contains another.

```python
# Can't spell slaughter without laughter
>>> "laughter" in "slaughter"
True

# There's no I in team
>>> "i" not in "team"
True
```

## Lexicographic Comparison

Lexicographic comparison actually does what you intuitively would expect `s1 < s2` would do: it checks whether `s1` would come before `s2` in a dictionary.

```python
>>> "Aaronson" < "Zukowski"
True
```

Remark, however, the following details:

- Comparison is _case sensitive_: `"B" < "a"` evaluates to `True`, because uppercase letters are considered "smaller" than lowercase letters.
- Every character (`5`, `@`, space, &hellip;) has a specific place in the "alphabet".
  For example, `' ' < 'A'`.
  The actual order is determined by [The Unicode Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters).

## String Length

Admittedly, `len` is not an operator but just a function.
But do you really want a separate page just for `len`?

`len` hides no surprises: it returns the length of the string.

```python
>>> len('schnackenpfefferhausen')
22
```
