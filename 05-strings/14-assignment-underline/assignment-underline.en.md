# Underline

We wish to underline strings as follows:

```text
Some string
-----------
```

In other words, we want to add an extra line that contains as many dashes as the string is long.

### `TASK`

Write a function `underline(string)` that returns a new string consisting of two lines:

- The first line must be equal to `string`.
- The second line consists solely of dashes.
  It must be exactly as long as the first line.

#### `HINT`

Here's an example of a string containing two lines:

```python
"first line\nsecond line"
```
