# Mask

We have a document filled with passwords and wish to hide them.
For this, we need a helper function that converts each password into a series of asterisks.

### `TASK`

Write a function `mask(password)` that receives a string `password` and returns a string of the same length that contains only asterisks (`*`).

#### USAGE

```python
>>> mask("x")
"*"

>>> mask("azer1234")
"********"
```
