# Extra String Operations

Programs are instructions that apply operations on all kinds of objects (integers, booleans, strings, &hellip;).
As of yet, these operations have taken two forms:

- Operators like `a + b`, `a - b`, `a < b`,`a == b`, `a and b`, `not a`, etc.
- Functions like `len(a)`, `min(a, b)`, etc.
  Functions are more flexible than operators thanks to their ability to have any number of operands/parameters.

There's also a third form: _methods_.
Their syntax is `a.method(b, c, d, ...)`.
You can interpret this as "I ask object `a` to perform its operation `method` with arguments `b, c, d, ...`".
A method is in essence a function that is a part of an object, and the syntax `a.method` asks `a` for that part.
Don't worry if this does not make sense yet, right now we only need to focus on the syntax.

### `INFO`

Why there is this third form of syntax will become apparent later.
The idea of functions being part of objects is central to the [object oriented paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#OOP_languages), a topic which will be discussed later.

## String Methods

Strings come with a bunch of methods.
We give an overview of a selection of them.
A full list of string methods can be found [online](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

| Method                 | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `s.lower()`            | Returns a lowercase copy of `s`                                   |
| `s.upper()`            | Returns an uppercase copy of `s`                                  |
| `s.find(subs)`         | Returns the index of `subs` in `s`                                |
| `s.startswith(prefix)` | Checks if `s` starts with `prefix`                                |
| `s.endswith(suffix)`   | Checks if `s` ends on `suffix`                                    |
| `s.strip()`            | Returns a copy where whitespace at both ends have been removed    |
| `s.lstrip()`           | Returns a copy where whitespace at the start have been removed    |
| `s.rstrip()`           | Returns a copy where whitespace at the end have been removed      |
| `s.ljust(width, fill)` | Returns a left justified copy of size `width` padded with `fill`  |
| `s.rjust(width, fill)` | Returns a right justified copy of size `width` padded with `fill` |

### `EXAMPLE`

`lower()` and `upper()` work as you would expect.

```python
>>> "ABC".lower()
"abc"

>>> "Test".upper()
"TEST"
```

### `EXAMPLE`

`string.find(s)` looks for `s` within `string`.
If `s` occurs somewhere inside `string`, the starting index is returned, otherwise `-1`.

```python
>>> "some string".find("tri")
6

# -1 in case substring was not found
>>> "some string".find("abc")
-1
```

### `EXAMPLE`

`ljust`, `rjust` and `center` help with formatting strings.

```python
>>> 'abc'.rjust(10)
'       abc'

# We can choose the padding character
>>> 'abc'.rjust(10, '.')
'.......abc'

>>> ' title '.center(20, '=')
'====== title ======='
```
