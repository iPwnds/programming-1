# Distance

We want to compute the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on a 2D plane.
The formula to determine this distance is

$$
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

Write a function `distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)` that computes the distance between the points with coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

#### `HINT`

If you want to know how to compute the square root: $\sqrt{x} = x^\frac{1}{2}$.
