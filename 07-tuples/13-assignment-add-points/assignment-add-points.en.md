# Adding Points

A point has an x- and y-coordinate.
We can represent a point as a tuple: `(x, y)`.

It is possible to add two points: it is a matter of adding their coordinates together.
For example, adding `(1, 3)` and `(2, 5)` gives `(3, 8)`.

### `TASK`

Write a function `add_points(p1, p2)` that returns the sum of the two given points `p1` and `p2`.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> add_points((1, 3), (2, 5))
(3, 8)
```
