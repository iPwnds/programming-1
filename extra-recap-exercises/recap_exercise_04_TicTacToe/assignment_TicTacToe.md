## Tic Tac Toe
Your task is to create a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the terminal by two players. Write the script step by step, by identifying the necessary information and game flow. 
Tip: Playing the game might be of great help!

### Game Rules
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol on the board, aiming to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If neither player manages to align three symbols and the board is full, the game ends in a tie.

### Requirements
* Display the game board as a 3x3 grid
* Each player should be able to enter their name and choose a unique symbol (tick).
* Players should take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell by entering the cellâ€™s index (0-8).
* The game should check for a winner after each move and announce if a player has won or if the game is a tie.
* If a player selects an occupied cell, instruct them to choose a different cell.

EXTRA
* Display a grid with the indices to make it easier for the players to choose the right index.
* Implement input validation to ensure only valid integers (0-8) are accepted for cell selection.
