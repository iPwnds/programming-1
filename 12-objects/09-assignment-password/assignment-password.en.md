# Password

### `TASK`

Write a class `Password`.

- Its constructor takes a string that represents a password.
- It stores this password in a private field named `password` (adapt this name as needed).
- Define a method `verify(string)` that checks if the given `string` is equal to the password.

Note how the class makes the password inaccessible from outside, but still allows to check whether a given password is correct.
The class's public interface does not leak any information about the password.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> password = Password('azer1234')
>>> password.verify('qwer1234')
False

>>> password.verify('azer1234')
True
```

#### `IMPORTANT`

In reality, the password will _never_ be stored directly as it is an unacceptable security risk.
Instead, a [hash digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Password_verification) will be stored.
This still allows the password to be verified, but if the hash digest were to become public, the accounts will not be compromised.
