# Constructor

The `__init__` method creates and initializes fields.
It is possible to pass it parameters so that you can choose what the field's values are set to.


```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, initial_contents):
        self.contents = initial_contents
```



Creating a `Box` object now requires a parameter:


```python
>>> box = Box(5)
>>> box.contents
5
```

### `INFO`
It is often easier to have the parameter have the same name as the field:

```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, contents):
        self.contents = contents
```
