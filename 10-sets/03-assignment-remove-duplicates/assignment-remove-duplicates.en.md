# Remove Duplicates

### `TASK`

Write a function `remove_duplicates(xs)` that takes a list `xs` and returns a copy with all duplicates removed.
The first occurrence of each value must be left untouched.
The order must be preserved.

Make sure your code is efficient as the tests will feed your function large inputs.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> remove_duplicates([1])
[1]

>>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 1])
[1, 2]

>>> remove_duplicates([1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1])
[1, 3, 2, 4]
```
