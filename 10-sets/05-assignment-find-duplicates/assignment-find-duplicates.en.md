# Find Duplicates

### `TASK`

Write a function `find_duplicates(xs)` that looks for all duplicates in the list `xs`.

- Return the duplicates as a list.
- Every duplicate has to be mentioned only once.
- The order in which the duplicate elements are listed does not matter.
- Make sure your code is efficient.

#### USAGE

```python
# No duplicates
>>> find_duplicates([1, 2])
[]

>>> find_duplicates([1, 2, 1])
[1]

>>> find_duplicates([1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1])
[1, 2]
```
