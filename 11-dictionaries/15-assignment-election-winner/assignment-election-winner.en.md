# Election Winner

As promised before, we revisit the election problem.
Using `dict`s, it should be easier to solve it.

### `TASK`

Write a function `election_winner(votes)` that returns the winner of the election, i.e., the element of `votes` that occurs most often.

- If there's a tie between winners, you are free to return any winner.
- If no votes have been cast, return `None`.
