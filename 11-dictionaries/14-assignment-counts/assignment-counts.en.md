# Counts

### `TASK`

Write a function `counts(xs)` that returns the frequencies of the elements of `xs` as a `dict`:

- All elements in `xs` must appear as key in the resulting `dict`.
- `result[x]` must equal the number of times `x` occurs in `xs`.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> counts(['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c'])
{
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3
}
```

#### `INFO`

This functionality [already exists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects) in Python's standard library.
Don't rely on it though for solving this exercise.
